<h2 align="center"This repo exists only to perform simple post-release / integration testing</h2>


## Description

This is a collection of simple automated integration level tests which are run after the release of any @nevware21 component
to validate that the released packages are complete and do not contain / reference un-released or unavailable components.

This is intended to provide integration level testing to provide a first level of defense and notification should any module
be unexpectedly released with errors.

No package releases are expected from this repo.
